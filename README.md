# Solar Power Tracking using MERN - Backend
Track home solar power generation and learn the MERN stack at the same time.

## Installation

### Install Yarn

[Use Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

```
corepack enable
yarn init -2
```

This will setup to use the latest Yarn, v4.6.0 as of this writing.

### Install Typescript

We'll be using Typescript as the main language in this project.

```
yarn add @types/node
yarn add typescript
yarn tsc --init
yarn add ts-node
```

### Install Express (The E in MERN)

`yarn add express`
`yarn add @types/express`

#### Express Generator

For reference, I added then removed express generator to get the basic template setup.
`yarn add express-generator`
`yarn express solar`
At this point I added all the additional packages generated by express-generator to package.json
`yarn add cookie-parser`
`yarn add debug`
`yarn add http-errors`
`yarn add jade`
`yarn add morgan`

Then I duplicated all the newly added folders and files in the src directory with the exception of the package.json

I then removed express-generator as it was no longer needed
`yarn remove express-generator`

And of course convert everything to typescript.

### Other libraries

`yarn add dotenv`

### Other setup
